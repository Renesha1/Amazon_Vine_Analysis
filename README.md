# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. There were a lot of different products that neededto be analyzed but I decided to choose gift cards.
  
## Results 
 `Reviews`
  + There were no Vine reviews 
  + There were 355 None-Vine reviews
`5 Stars`
  + There were 0 Vine reviews(non-applicable)
  + There were 90 Non-Vine that recieved 5 stars
 `Percentage of reviews`
  + Non-applicable for Vine reviews
  + 25% of the Non-Vine reviews were 5 stars
 
## Summary
  There were no paid Vine reviews to analyze. By the results, Amazon should make it a point to advertise the gift cards and gather some paid reviewers for a proffessional opinion, especially since the rate of the non-paid reviews are only 25% for 5 stars. Paying reviewers for the Vine reviews would target the areas that needs work which would help increase the percentage of 5 stars.
